Alchem is an open source 2D java game engine.

# Installation

To run the engine, download this repository and Eclipse IDE. Open the repository in Eclipse as a project, and run the Main class in the main package. Note: If the engine does not run, one possible solution is to add -XstartOnFirstThread to the VM arguments(see [this question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/64624044/lwjgl-glfwcreatewindow-causes-crash) on stack overflow).
